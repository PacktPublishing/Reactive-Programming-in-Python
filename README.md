# Reactive-Programming-in-Python
This is the code repository for [Reactive Programming in Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-programming-python-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video will be your guide to getting started with Reactive programming in Python. You will begin with the general concepts of Reactive programming and then gradually move on to work with asynchronous data streams.

You will then be introduced to functional reactive programming and will learn to apply FRP in practical use cases in Python. You will understand how ReactiveX works and how it efficiently supports sequences of data. You will then understand the role of asynchronous programming and event-based programming in detail to build reactive extensions.

You will learn to create dataflow-based systems, the building blocks of reactive programming. This course will take you through creating, merging, filtering, transforming, and error-handling observables to extend your asynchronous code.

You will then learn to scale applications using multi-node clusters and will learn to unit-test your clusters. This video also introduces you to Reactive microservices with Python.

All the code and supporting files for this course are available on GitHub at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Reactive-Programming-in-Python
